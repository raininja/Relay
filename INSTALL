DEPENDENCIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These are listed as Ubuntu packages. (They are reported to be the same on Arch 
Linux as well)  You may need to adjust for your distribution.
To compile you will need the following dependencies:

~~automake~~ meson
libglib2.0-dev
~~libx11-dev~~
valac-0.26 
libgranite-dev
libsqlite3-dev
libgee-0.8-dev
libgtk-3-dev
libunity-dev
libtool-bin or libtool depending on the distro

If you are on a distribution that uses apt-get you can use the following command.
(sudo apt-get install libtool-bin libtool libgtk-3-dev libgee-0.8-dev libsqlite3-dev libgranite-dev valac-0.26 libx11-dev libglib2.0-dev automake libunity-dev)

(Other versions of valac may work. But newer versions seems to have a bug that prevents compiling)

BUILDING AND INSTALLING - DEPRECATED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mkdir build
cd build
../autogen.sh
make
sudo make install

If you want to use the program without installing you must install the settings gsettings xml file in /data/com.github.raininja.relay.gschema.xml
Running make install does this automatically.
